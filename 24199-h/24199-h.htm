<h5>I.</h5>

<p><i>One Epistle To Mr. Pope</i>, complained Pope to Bethel, “contains
as many Lyes as Lines.” But just for that reason it is not, as Pope also
says in the same letter, “below all notice.”<a class = "tag" name =
"tag_i1" id = "tag_i1" href = "#note_i1">1</a> <i>The Blatant Beast</i>,
published twelve years later, is another attack on Pope almost as
compendious and quite as virulent. They are here presented to the modern
student of Pope as good examples of their kind. The importance of the
pamphlet attacks on Pope for a full understanding of his satiric art is
universally admitted, but the pamphlets themselves were cheap and
ephemeral, and copies are now rare and not easily come by. Both in the
comprehensiveness of their charges and in the slashing hatred which
informs them (however feeble the verse), <i>One Epistle</i> and <i>The
Blatant Beast</i> offer as fair a sample as any two such pamphlets can
of the calumny, detraction, and critical misunderstanding Pope endured,
for the most part patiently, from the publication of his <i>Essay on
Criticism</i> to the year of his death. “Welcome for thee, fair Virtue!
all the past,” (<i>Epistle to Arbuthnot</i>, l.&nbsp;358) he exclaimed
in his role as Satirist.</p>

<p>It was this public proclamation of Virtue that confused and enraged
the Dunces. We have again learned to read satire as something quite
other than an expression of personal malice and misanthropy. What the
present pamphlets amply testify to is that most of the Dunces were no
more able to read satire properly than were Pope’s nineteenth-century
critics. They were, as Pope quite properly kept pointing out, very bad
writers and very dull men. The <i>ethos</i> of the satiric
<i>persona</i> was something they could not understand. Although some of
the Dunces knew their classics well and although all of them, we may
presume, read the Roman satirists, one did not, typically, in Grub
Street consult one’s Horace with diurnal hand; one consulted the public.
Literature to them was sold. They were not deeply concerned about
absolute standards of right and wrong, about works of imagination which
justify an entire civilization, about the problem of tradition and the
individual talent. Accordingly, they explained satire, with the only
<span class = "pagenum">- ii -</span>
vocabulary they had, as the expression of ingratitude, purely personal
malice, and demonic pride, the product of a diseased heart and a
misshapen body.</p>

<p>It would be misleading to suggest a narrow definition of Pope’s
Dunces. Some were critics of worth, such as Dennis and Gildon; some were
not despicable minor poets, such as Welsted and Cooke. But if we leave
these aside, as well as his aristocratic enemies, Lady Mary and Lord
Hervey, some valid generalizations emerge. The very persistency of the
Dunces’ attacks on Pope (I&nbsp;have located over one hundred and fifty
published during Pope’s lifetime) and the large number of anonymous
pamphlets that we cannot definitely ascribe to anyone Pope ever
mentioned suggest that the Battle of the Dunces is best seen
economically and sociologically. They were, for the most part,
hack-writers, who were attempting the commercialization of literature
that Pope recognized and deplored. Since they were authors to be let,
they were neither fastidious about standards of taste nor filled with
reverence for the Word. Yet Pope had succeeded in doing what they could
not do--he had made himself a moderately rich man entirely by writing
poetry. No theme recurs more insistently and suggestively in Popiana
than Pope’s wealth. Faced with the nasty fact that if one wrote well
enough, there was a public to support one, they could only accuse Pope
monotonously of venality and avarice.</p>

<p>In all of this there is a strong element of class antagonism. The
Dunces were middle-class and Whiggish, their spirit capitalist. Pope,
though middle-class by birth, was aristocratic in his sympathies, Tory
in a loose sense, and firmly anti-Walpole. Perhaps verse satire is
essentially aristocratic. Perhaps wit is, too. Certainly they never seem
at home in a middle-class society. Wit comes to savor of indecency and
blasphemy; satire in its incessant defence of moral value and centers of
order comes to seem the expression of an arrogant disdain and a
disquieting unease. His poise and verbal brilliance and hieratic
commitment to the venerable tradition of classical and Christian ethical
thought set the Satirist coolly apart from the <i>profanum vulgus</i>.
Had Pope never mentioned one of the Dunces, although they would have
done so less frequently, they would still have cried out against
him.</p>

<h5>II.</h5>

<p><i>One Epistle To Mr. A. Pope, Occasion’d By Two Epistles Lately
Published</i> appeared, according to the <i>Daily Journal</i>, on 28
April 1730.<a class = "tag" name = "tag_i2" id = "tag_i2" href =
"#note_i2">2</a> Pope’s mention of it in Appendix II to <i>The
Dunciad&nbsp;A</i>, his “List of Books, Papers, and Verses, in which our
Author <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘was / was’ at line break">was</ins>
abused” which is our best guide to Popiana, is somewhat
confusing and made more difficult because the first part dates from
1729, the second from 1735: “<i>Labeo</i>, A&nbsp;Paper of Verses
written by Leonard Welsted. [1729 a-d], which after came into One
Epistle, and was publish’d by James Moore. 4to. 1730. Another part of it
came out in Welsted’s own name in 1731, under the just Title of
<i>Dulness and Scandal</i>, fol. [1735a].”<a class = "tag" name =
"tag_i3" id = "tag_i3" href = "#note_i3">3</a></p>

<p>The <i>Labeo</i> reference is mysterious. Pope in his note on Welsted
to <i>The Dunciad A</i> II.293 had said in a sentence omitted in all
editions from 1735a, “The strength of the metaphors in this passage is
to express the great scurrility and fury of this writer, which may be
seen, One day, in a Piece of his, call’d (as I think) <i>Labeo</i>.”<a
class = "tag" name = "tag_i4" id = "tag_i4" href = "#note_i4">4</a>
Since no <i>Labeo</i> has ever turned up, it seems reasonable to
conclude with Fineman that, though Welsted may have toyed with the idea
of writing one, “he either never did enough with it to warrant its
publication, or discarded it entirely in favor of writing the
collaborative <i>One Epistle to Mr. Pope</i> that appeared in 1730.
Naturally, he would not broadcast his plans, and as a result the enemy
camp continued to believe--or at any rate, to say--that Welsted would
retaliate with a <i>Labeo</i>.”<a class = "tag" name = "tag_i5" id =
"tag_i5" href = "#note_i5">5</a> This was in 1729; by 1735 Pope had
realized no <i>Labeo</i> would appear and deciding, apparently on no
evidence, that it had been incorporated into Welsted’s <i>One
Epistle</i> and <i>Of Dulness and Scandal</i> (1732), made the
appropriate changes in <i>The Dunciad</i>.</p>

<p>Pope did not at first realize that <i>One Epistle</i> was by Welsted.
It had been announced as early as 1&nbsp;Feb. 1729 in <i>The Universal
Spectator</i> “as the due Chastisement of Mr. Pope for his
<i>Dunciad</i>, by James Moore Smythe, Esq; and Mr. Welsted.” The poem
must have been circulated privately before publication at least by
October, 1729 at which time Pope believed it to be Lady Mary’s, since we
find Lady Mary writing to Dr. Arbuthnot twice in October 1729 denying
Pope’s accusation that she had written it.<a class = "tag" name =
"tag_i6" id = "tag_i6" href = "#note_i6">6</a> There is no evidence that
she was not telling the truth, but on 21 May 1730 <i>The Grub-Street
Journal</i> reported that Lady Mary had “some hand in the piece.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">- iv -</span>
<p>Like most Pope attacks, the poem was published anonymously. The
preface, a&nbsp;defence of the Dunces, is, with probably <ins class =
"correction" title = "text reads ‘international’">intentional</ins>
ambiguity, written in the first person singular but ends by referring to
“the Writers of the following Poem” (p.&nbsp;viii). One hand seems
responsible for the preface, but we can only conclude that a Dunce
collaborating with other Dunces produced the poem. Four days after its
publication Pope wrote to Broome that it was “by James Moore and
others,” and a few weeks later wrote to Bethel that “James Moore own’d
it but was made by three others, and he will disown it whenever any man
takes him for it.”<a class = "tag" name = "tag_i7" id = "tag_i7" href =
"#note_i7">7</a> It was Moore Smythe who was attacked in <i>The
Grub-Street Journal</i> for several months as the poem’s chief author.<a
class = "tag" name = "tag_i8" id = "tag_i8" href = "#note_i8">8</a></p>

<p>A letter from Welsted to Dodington, however, shows that though the
poem was a collaborative effort and though others may have made
suggestions and additions, Welsted felt himself responsible for the
poem.<a class = "tag" name = "tag_i9" id = "tag_i9" href =
"#note_i9">9</a> In 1735 Pope attributed <i>One Epistle</i> finally to
Welsted, with Moore Smythe as publisher, and in 1737 <i>The Memoirs of
Grub-Street</i> said of Moore Smythe that he “reported himself author”
of <i>One Epistle</i>, “but was only a publisher; it being written by
Mr. Welsted and others<ins class = "correction" title =
"close quote missing">.”</ins><a class = "tag" name = "tag_i10" id = "tag_i10" href =
"#note_i10">10</a></p>

<p>As to the “others” we should remember Mallet’s caution that it would
be vain,</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>To guess, ere <i>One Epistle</i> saw the light,</p>
<p>How many brother-dunces club’d their mite.<a class = "tag" name =
"tag_i11" id = "tag_i11" href = "#note_i11">11</a></p>
</div>

<p>Welsted himself had begun his quarrel with Pope with an attack on
<i>Three Hours after Marriage</i>, that amusing and much-abused play, in
<i>Palaemon To Caelia at Bath; Or, The Triumvirate</i> (1717). Pope is
said to have collaborated with Gay not only in <i>Three Hours</i>,
a&nbsp;play “so lewd,/ Ev’n Bullies blush’d, and Beaux astonish’d stood”
(Second Edition, p.&nbsp;11), but in <i>The Wife of Bath</i> and <i>The
What D’Ye Call It</i>. Welsted also hits at <i>God’s Revenge Against
Punning</i>, the <i>First Psalm</i>, praises Tickell, and finds Pope’s
versification flat. All of these charges (except the one that Pope
collaborated in <i>The Wife of Bath</i>) had appeared in print before,
but Pope was to remember <i>Palaemon To Caelia</i> and include it in a
note to <i>The Dunciad A</i> II.293, where it is neatly described as
“meant for a Satire on Mr. P. and some of his friends.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">- v -</span>
<p>In 1721 Welsted’s name appears in the title of a pamphlet containing
an attack on Pope’s Homer, <i>An Epistle To Mr. Welsted; And A Satyre on
the English Translations of Homer</i>, by that engagingly inept Dunce,
Bezaleel Morrice. In 1724 in the “Dissertation concerning the Perfection
of the English Language” prefixed to his <i>Epistles, Odes, &amp;c.</i>,
Welsted quoted (not quite correctly) and criticized Pope’s “And such as
<i>Chaucer</i> is, shall <i>Dryden</i> be” (p.&nbsp;x). The anonymous
author of <i>Characters of The Times</i> (1728) thought that Welsted
would have been spared Pope’s abuse if he had not in his “Dissertation”
“happen’d to cite a low and false line from Mr. P[o]pe for the meer
Purpose of refuting it, without seeming to know, or care who was the
Author of it” (p.&nbsp;24).<a class = "tag" name = "tag_i12" id =
"tag_i12" href = "#note_i12">12</a></p>

<p>In the <i>Peri Bathous</i> Pope included Welsted as a didapper and an
eel. Pope then put him into <i>The Dunciad</i> in II.293-300 and, more
memorably, in III.163-166:</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>Flow Welsted, Flow! like thine inspirer, Beer,</p>
<p>Tho’ stale, not ripe; tho’ thin, yet never clear;</p>
<p>So sweetly mawkish, and so smoothly dull;</p>
<p>Heady, not strong, and foaming tho’ not full.</p>
</div>

<p>Unable to leave well enough alone, Welsted continued his attack on
Pope with <i>One Epistle</i> and then again in January 1732 with <i>Of
Dulness and Scandal</i>, which ran to three editions. The half-title of
<i>One Epistle</i> had promised that it was to be continued, and the
writer of the preface had said that he intended “in the preface to the
next Epistle ... to state several Matters of Fact, in Contradiction to
the Notes of the <i>Dunciad</i>” (p.&nbsp;viii). <i>Of Dulness and
Scandal</i>, however, has no preface and is an independent attack. Its
main charge is Pope’s ingratitude to the Duke of Chandos as shown in the
<i>Epistle to Burlington</i>, a&nbsp;famous charge frequently to be
repeated,<a class = "tag" name = "tag_i13" id = "tag_i13" href =
"#note_i13">13</a> but it claims as well that a lady named Victoria died
as a result of reading Pope’s Homer and attacks once more <i>The Rape of
the Lock</i> and the <i>First Psalm</i>.</p>

<p>In February 1732 Welsted published his last attack on Pope, <i>Of
False Fame</i>, in which he attacks <i>Windsor Forest</i>, <i>The Rape
of the Lock</i>, Pope’s edition of Shakespeare, <i>The Dunciad</i>, and
the <i>Epistle to Burlington</i>. Pope then mentioned him in the
<i>Epistle to Arbuthnot</i>, at first in l.&nbsp;49, although he altered
this to “Pitholeon,” and then in l.&nbsp;375, where most
twentieth-century college students first meet his name.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">- vi -</span>
<p>The charges in <i>One Epistle</i> are unusually comprehensive, but
almost none of them is original. To help the reader to evaluate the more
important, the following notes may be helpful. The denial in the preface
of Pope’s statement that no one is attacked in <i>The Dunciad</i> “who
had not before, either in Print or private Conversation, endeavour’d
something to his Disadvantage” (p.&nbsp;v) is a reference to <i>The
Dunciad</i>, p.&nbsp;203, where, however, conversation is not mentioned.
This sentence of Pope’s annoyed many of the Dunces.<a class = "tag" name
= "tag_i14" id = "tag_i14" href = "#note_i14">14</a> What the preface
says about Swift and Arbuthnot and the <i>Peri Bathous</i> (p.&nbsp;vii)
may well be true.<a class = "tag" name = "tag_i15" id = "tag_i15" href =
"#note_i15">15</a> Welsted’s charge that Pope wrote the Prologue to
<i>Cato</i> and then “the Play decried” (p.&nbsp;12) is simply Dennis’s
old charge first made in <i>A&nbsp;True Character of Mr. Pope (1716)</i>
and repeated in <i>Remarks Upon ... the Dunciad</i> (1729) that Pope had
teased Lintot into publishing Dennis’s attack on <i>Cato</i>. The charge
rests only on Dennis’s authority.<a class = "tag" name = "tag_i16" id =
"tag_i16" href = "#note_i16">16</a> The obscenity of <i>The Rape of the
Lock</i> was an old story.<a class = "tag" name = "tag_i17" id =

the <i>Peri Bathous</i>, and <i>The Dunciad</i> are simply the
commonplaces of Popiana. The charge that he libeled Addison only after
the great man’s death is also familiar<a class = "tag" name = "tag_i19"
id = "tag_i19" href = "#note_i19">19</a> (Welsted seems to have been the
first, though, to mention the libel on Lady Mary) and long since
disproved by Sherburn and Ault. That Pope was a plagiarist is an idea
that turns up constantly.<a class = "tag" name = "tag_i20" id =
"tag_i20" href = "#note_i20">20</a></p>

<p>Welsted’s other charges are more interesting. He seems to be the only
Dunce who objected (p.&nbsp;12) to Pope’s mentioning Bishop Hoadly in
<i>The Dunciad A</i> II.368. It may just possibly be true that Gildon
was dismissed by Buckingham because of Gildon’s dislike of Pope
(p.&nbsp;22).<a class = "tag" name = "tag_i21" id = "tag_i21" href =
"#note_i21">21</a></p>

<p>The most curious of the charges is that Pope,</p>

<div class = "verse nospace">
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;... from the Skies, propitious to the Fair,</p>
<p>Brought down <i>Caecilia</i>, and sent <i>Cloris</i> there.
(p.&nbsp;11)</p>
</div>

<p class = "nospace">
Welsted apparently means that Pope debased St. Cecilia in his <i>Ode for
Musick on St. Cecilia’s Day</i> and glorified a suicide in his <i>Elegy
to the Memory of an Unfortunate Lady</i>. He is not saying, as did
<i>The Life of the late Celebrated Mrs. Elizabeth Wisebourn</i> (1721),
that the heroine of the <i>Elegy</i> died of her unrequited love for
Pope. Pope’s note to l.&nbsp;375 of the <i>Epistle to Arbuthnot</i>
accusing Welsted of having “had the Impudence to tell in print, that Mr.
<i>P.</i> had
<span class = "pagenum">- vii -</span>
occasion’d a Lady’s death, and to <i>name</i> a person he never heard
of” refers not to Cloris but to Victoria in Welsted’s <i>Of Dulness and
Scandal</i> who died from reading Pope’s <ins class = "correction" title

<p>The <i>Grub-Street Journal</i> for 21 May 1730 invited “any Person of

<p><i>The Blatant Beast</i> appeared in December 1742, according to
<i>The London Magazine</i>; its authorship remains unknown. Pope had
published <i>The New Dunciad</i> in March 1742, and Cibber had published
his famous <i>A Letter From Mr. Cibber, To Mr. Pope</i> in July. Five
other pamphlets attacking Pope appeared in August, obviously
capitalizing on the Cibber attack.</p>

<p><i>The Blatant Beast</i> is pro-Cibber, of course, but it criticizes
specifically only a few lines from <i>The New Dunciad</i>. The writer’s
chief interest is in a general attack. The criticisms of the
Shakespeare, of <i>Three Hours</i> and the <i>Epistle to Burlington</i>,
and of Pope’s plagiarism are perfectly conventional. More interesting is
the
<span class = "pagenum">- viii -</span>
accusation (p.&nbsp;6) that Pope wrote (as, of course, he did) his Homer
on the backs of personal letters. Also interesting is the reference to
Pope’s inscription on the Shakespeare monument in Westminster Abbey
(p.&nbsp;5). Pope was, with several others, responsible for the Latin
inscription; it does not seem that he had anything to do with the lines
from <i>The Tempest</i> IV.&nbsp;i.&nbsp;152-156, which were added
several months later. These lines are given in the first note to <i>The
Dunciad&nbsp;B</i> I. and, in slightly different form, in <i>The
Gentleman’s Magazine</i>, XI,&nbsp;276. The last line reads, “Leave not
a wreck behind.” Pope’s version of the lines in both his 1725 and 1728
editions of Shakespeare (Griffith 149 and 210) does not commit the
errors of the inscription and prints, “Leave not a rack behind!”<a class
= "tag" name = "tag_i23" id = "tag_i23" href = "#note_i23">23</a> The
bantering note about the monument which begins <i>The Dunciad&nbsp;B</i>
may have been prompted by this passage in <i>The Blatant Beast</i> as
well as by the comment of Theobald which Sutherland refers&nbsp;to.</p>

<p>But it is the shrill personal abuse of Pope’s deformity and moral
obliquity,</p>

<div class = "verse nospace">
<p>The Morals blacken’d when the Writings scape;</p>
<p>The libel’d Person, and the pictur’d Shape</p>

<p class = "right">(<i>Epistle to Arbuthnot</i>, ll. 353-353)</p>
</div>

<p class = "nospace">
which is most impressive. The writer shows a talent for <ins class =
"correction" title = "text reads ‘invenctive’">invective</ins>, but
there is a good deal of evidence that he was well-read in other Pope
attacks. The phrase, Pope’s “Mountain Shoulders,” (p.&nbsp;5) recalls
Pope’s “Mountain Back” in <i>The Difference Between Verbal and Practical
Virtue</i>, p.&nbsp;5, published in August 1742. The image of the wasp
(pp. 6, 10) had appeared in Hervey’s and Lady Mary’s <i>Verses Address’d
to the Imitator Of ... Horace</i> (1733), p.&nbsp;7,<a class = "tag"
name = "tag_i24" id = "tag_i24" href = "#note_i24">24</a> as had the
metaphor of Pope as Satan (pp.&nbsp;5-6) with which <i>The Blatant
Beast</i> opens.<a class = "tag" name = "tag_i25" id = "tag_i25" href =
"#note_i25">25</a></p>

<p>Pope had already been pictured as a mad dog (p.&nbsp;7) in <i>The
Metamorphosis</i> (1728), attributed by Pope to Smedley and one of the
least pleasant of the pamphlets. Pope as Aesop’s toad bursting with
spleen (p.&nbsp;12) had been used in <i>Codrus</i> (1728), p.&nbsp;12,
attributed by Pope to Curll and Mrs. Thomas. Cibber’s prevention of Pope
from peopling the isle with Calibans (p.&nbsp;9) is a reference, of
course, to Cibber’s famous anecdote about rescuing Pope in the
bawdy-house; but in <i>Mr. Taste, The Poetical Fop</i> (1732) where Pope
figures as the monkey-like poetaster Taste, the servant-maid who
<span class = "pagenum">- ix -</span>
was to have married him is delighted the marriage is broken off, “for
fear our children should have resembled Baboons, Ha, ha, ha!”
(p.&nbsp;73). Stern anti-sentimentalists sometimes point out that we
react too squeamishly to the abuse of Pope’s deformity. I&nbsp;doubt it
myself. The eighteenth century was probably a coarser and more outspoken
age than ours, but scurrilous attacks on the physical appearance of
distinguished poets do not otherwise seem to have been a prominent
feature of the Augustan literary scene.</p>

<p>It is hoped that both these pamphlets will prove useful to those who
have little first-hand knowledge of what his enemies said of Pope and
will help to warn the novice of the fatal ease with which we can read
“with but a Lust to mis-apply,/ Make Satire a Lampoon, and Fiction, Lye”
(<i>Epistle to Arbuthnot</i>, ll. 301-302).</p>

<p><i>One Epistle</i> was reprinted by John Nichols in his edition of
<i>The Works in Verse and Prose of Leonard Welsted</i> (London, 1787).
Nichols normalizes the text, spells out several names in full, and adds
several unimportant notes. It is here reproduced from the copy in the
Sterling Library, Yale University. <i>The Blatant Beast</i> has never
been reprinted and is reproduced from the copy in the Huntington
Library.</p>

<p><span class = "hidden">T</span>HE indecent Images, and the frequent
and bad Imitations of the Classics in the <em>Dunciad</em>, have
occasioned several just Observations upon so new and coarse a Manner of
Writing: I&nbsp;shall wave this Topic at present, and only regard the
most plausible Insinuation in Favour of this Author; which is, that he
never begun an Attack upon any Person, who had not before, either in
Print or private Conversation, endeavour’d something to his
Disadvantage.</p>

<p>This Assertion is by no means true, as I shall immediately shew; if
it were true, it might indeed bear some Weight, but however with this
Distinction, that the Reports of private
<span class = "pagenum">vi</span>
Conversation, brought to him by such Emissaries, as belong to him, are
not always to be believed, and that no Attack in Print upon a Man’s
Poetical Character, ought to be repaid by Lampoon and Virulence upon the
Moral Character of his Antagonist: Every Person has a Right to determine
upon the Talents of Writers, particularly of one, who appears in Publick
only to gratify the two worst Appetites, that disgrace Human Nature,
I&nbsp;mean Malice and Avarice; and sure no Man deserves a violent
Injury to his Reputation, as a Gentleman, because perhaps at a Distance
of several Years since he might have said, that Mr. <em>Pope</em> had
nothing in him Original as a Writer, that Mr. <em>Tickel</em> greatly
excelled him in his Translation of <em>Homer</em>, and many of his
Contemporaries in other Branches of Writing, and that he is infinitely
inferior to Mr. <em>Phillips</em> in Pastoral: And yet such Arguments or
Apologies as these have been used by himself, or his Tea-Table Cabals,
for calling Gentlemen Scoundrels, Blockheads, Gareteers, and Beggars<ins
class = "correction" title = "punctuation unchanged">,:</ins> If he can
transmit them to Posterity under such Imputations, he is a bad Man; if
he cannot, he is a bad Writer: I&nbsp;believe, that he would rather
suffer under the first Character, than the last: But before I have done
with him, I&nbsp;will make a very strict Inquiry into both.</p>

<p>In the mean time I shall shew the Reader, in general, the Falshood of
his main Pretence, that he has meddled with no one, that had not before
hurt him, and in this View, tho’ I should be ashamed of being too
serious in a Controversy of this Sort, I&nbsp;think it proper to
acquaint the Town with the original Design of the <em>Dunciad</em>, and
the real Reasons of its Production. This Piece, which has been honour’d
by Booksellers of Quality, contains only the Poetical Part of Dulness,
extracted from a Libel, call’d, <em>The Progress of it</em>, and which
included several other
<span class = "pagenum">vii</span>
Branches of Science, and perhaps some of those Gentlemen, who have in
the warmest Manner asserted the Cause of the <em>Dunciad</em>, might
have seen a Publication of a Work, upon the Death of this Writer, in
which no past Friendship could have screen’d them from Lampoon for any
Pretences to excel in any Science whatever: It appears, therefore, that
he was teaz’d into a Publication of these Cantos, which regarded the
Writers of the Age, by some Attacks, that were made upon him about that
Time: We must refer to a Miscellany of Poems published by Him and
<em>Swift</em>, to which is prefix’d, <em>An Essay on the Profund</em>,
to consider if those Attacks were justifiable; Mr. Dean <em>Swift</em>
never saw the <em>Profund</em>, till made publick, and Dr.
<ins class = "correction" title = "spelling unchanged (elsewhere ‘Arbuthnot’)"><em>Arburthnot</em></ins>,
who originally sketch’d the Design of it, desired that the Initial Letters of Names of the Gentlemen
abused might not be inserted, that they might be <em>A</em> or
<em>B</em>, or <em>Do</em> or <em>Ro</em>, or any thing of that Nature,
which would make this Satire a general one upon any dull Writers in any
Age: This was refused by <em>Pope</em>, and he chose rather to treat a
Set of Gentlemen as Vermin, Reptiles, <em>&amp;c.</em> at a Time when he
had no Provocation to do so, when he had closed his Labours, finish’d
his great Subscriptions, and was in a fashionable Degree of Reputation:
Several Gentlemen, who are there ranked with the dullest Men, or dullest
Beasts, never did appear in Print against him, or say any thing in
Conversation which might affect his Character: Some Replies, which were
made to the <em>Profund</em>, occasioned the Publication of the
<em>Dunciad</em>, which was first of all begun with a general Malice to
all Mankind, and now appears under an Excuse of Provocations, which he
had received, after he himself had struck the first Blow in the
above-mentioned Miscellanies.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">viii</span>
<p>I cannot indeed say much in Praise of some Performances, which
appear’d against him, and am sorry that Voluntiers enter’d into the War,
whom I could wish to have been only Spectators: But the Cause became so
general, that some Gentlemen, who never aim’d at the Laurel, grew Poets
merely upon their being angry: A&nbsp;Militia, in Case of publick
Invasion, may perhaps be thought necessary, but yet one could always
wish for an Army of regular Troops: I&nbsp;should not have touched upon
this Circumstance, but to obviate some Imputations, which he had
suggested, of my Writing several Pieces, which I never heard of, till I
saw them with the rest of the Town: But these Suggestions shall be
considered in the Preface to the next Epistle, in which, among other
Things, I&nbsp;intend to state several Matters of Fact, in Contradiction
to the Notes of the <em>Dunciad</em>, particularly as they concern the
Writers of the following Poem.</p>
